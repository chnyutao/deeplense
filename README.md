For Common Test I. Multi-Class Classification, you can find the under the `Common Test I/` directory
- Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb`,
- Weights for the trained ResNet model `model.pth`.

For Specific Test VI. SSL on Real Dataset, you can find under the `Specific Test VI/` directory
- Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb`,
- Weights for the AutoEncoder model `model-ae.pth`, `model-ae-clf.pth`,
- Weights for the SimCLR model `model-simclr.pth`, `model-simclr-clf.pth`.

Evaluation metrics (ROC, AUROC) can be found in the respective notebooks.
